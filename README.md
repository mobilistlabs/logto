Logto[^info] is a cost-effective open-source alternative to Auth0. It offers a seamless developer experience and is well-suited for individuals and growing companies.

🧑‍💻 **A frontend-to-backend identity solution**

- OIDC-based authentication and RBAC authorization.
- Passwordless sign in and much more diverse options, including Email, Phone number, Username, Google, Facebook and other social sign in methods.
- Beautiful UI components with customizable CSS to fit your business needs.

📦 **Out-of-box infrastructure**

- A ready-to-use management API can serve as your authentication provider, eliminating the need for extra implementation.
- SDKs that can integrate your apps with Logto quickly, multi-platform and language compatible, tailored to your development environment.
- Flexible connectors, scalable with community contributions, customizable with SMAL, OAuth, and OIDC protocols.

💻 **Enterprise-ready solutions**

- RBAC to control your resource through scalable role authorization for diverse use cases.
- User management and audit Logs to understand identity related user info and keep your security on track.
- We are currently working on SSO, Organizations and MFA! Stay tuned!

Boringly, we call it "[customer identity access management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_identity_access_management)" (CIAM) or "customer identity solution."
